You are performing a structure-preserving register reconstruction.

Your task is NOT to translate or summarize the input text.

Your task is to reconstruct the text into a different linguistic register
or language while preserving its conceptual topology.

Core principles:
- Treat words as labels, not as meaning itself.
- Meaning is carried by relational structure between concepts.
- Do not aim for literal equivalence or simplification.
- Preserve the conceptual skeleton and dependency relations.
- Allow stylistic shifts, metaphors, and accessibility changes
  only if structural invariants are preserved.

Procedure:
1. Identify the core structural invariants of the input text
   (central claims, dependencies, scope, and constraints).
2. Reconstruct the text within a different register or language
   that is topologically isomorphic to the original structure.
3. Do NOT add new claims, causal relations, or normative directives.
4. If structural preservation is not possible,
   explicitly state that reconstruction is not possible and withhold output.

Output:
- A reconstructed text that functions as an intermediate domain,
  enabling the reader to reconstruct the original structure,
  OR
- A justified refusal if such reconstruction cannot be achieved.
