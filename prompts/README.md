# About the Prompts

The prompts in this directory are not independent utilities.
They are concrete instantiations of a single guiding idea:

**understanding arises when conceptual structure becomes reconstructable,
not when text becomes shorter or simpler.**


## Shared Purpose

All prompts in this directory are designed to support
**structure-preserving reconstruction** of texts.

They do not aim to:

- translate content accurately,
- summarize information efficiently,
- convert tone or style for convenience,
- or produce ready-to-use explanatory outputs.

Instead, they aim to:

- preserve the conceptual topology of the source text,
- reconstruct it within a different linguistic register or language,
- and generate an *intermediate domain* in which
  the reader can reconstruct the original structure themselves.


## Structural Priority

Across all prompts, the following priorities are shared:

1. **Structure precedes wording**  
   Words are treated as labels.
   Meaning is carried by relational dependencies between concepts.

2. **Topology over surface equivalence**  
   Literal equivalence, stylistic fidelity, or lexical matching
   are explicitly deprioritized in favor of topological isomorphism.

3. **Reconstructability over readability**  
   Outputs are not judged by how “easy” they are to read,
   but by whether the reader can reconstruct the original structure
   from them.


## Allowed and Forbidden Operations

While registers and languages may vary,
the following constraints apply to all prompts.

### Allowed
- Register shifts (formal → casual, academic → colloquial, etc.)
- Metaphors, framing changes, and expressive amplification
- Linguistic or cultural adaptation

**Only if structural invariants are preserved.**

### Forbidden
- Adding new claims, arguments, or conclusions
- Introducing new causal or normative relations
- Collapsing distinctions for the sake of simplicity
- Replacing structure with affective or vibe-based paraphrasing


## Refusal and Silence as Valid Outcomes

If a reconstruction cannot preserve structure,
the correct behavior is **not to force an output**.

Explicit refusal, partial output with explanation,
or complete silence are all considered valid outcomes.

Failure to reconstruct is treated as
a meaningful observation about the limits of a given register,
not as an error.


## Language Independence

Prompts may be provided in multiple languages.
These are **not translations of one another**.

They are intended to be
**topologically isomorphic formulations of the same constraint structure**.

This reflects the core assumption of the project:
that understanding depends on structure,
not on any particular language.


## How to Use These Prompts

You are encouraged to:

- use them freely,
- modify them,
- combine them with other ideas or systems,
- or observe how and where they fail.

What matters is not whether a prompt “works,”
but what its behavior reveals about
structure, language, and understanding.


## Final Note

These prompts are not answers.

They are **constraints**.

Their purpose is not to think for the reader,
but to create conditions under which
the reader can think—and reconstruct—by themselves.
