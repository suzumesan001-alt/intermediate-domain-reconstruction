# Semantic Cluster Theory Documentation

## Introduction
Semantic clusters are groups of concepts or entities that are related to each other in a specific context. This theory aims to categorize information based on semantic relationships to improve data retrieval and understanding.

## Key Concepts
- **Clusters**: Groups of similar entities.
- **Semantic Relationships**: Connections between entities based on their meanings.
- **Context**: The scenario in which the entities are related.

## Applications
Semantic clustering can be applied in various fields, including:
- Information Retrieval
- Natural Language Processing
- Knowledge Graphs

## Steps in Semantic Clustering
1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and format the data.
3. **Clustering**: Use algorithms to group similar entities.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the quality of the clusters.

## Conclusion
Understanding semantic clusters enhances the ability to process complex information and draw meaningful inferences from it.
