# Intermediate Domain Reconstruction

This repository is not a translation or summarization tool.

It explores how understanding arises when complex texts are reconstructed
into topologically isomorphic intermediate linguistic domains.

The goal is not to produce simplified outputs,
but to induce reconstruction and expansion events
in the reader’s conceptual network.


## What This Repository Is

This repository does not aim to transform difficult theories or texts
into “easy-to-read finished products.”

Instead, it focuses on reconstructing the **structural conditions
under which understanding emerges in the human learner**.

At its core, this project asks:

- Why can a text be read but not understood?
- Why does a change in language, register, or expression sometimes suddenly make things clear?
- Under what structural conditions does the experience of “understanding” occur?

These questions are approached through the lens of
**topological (structural) isomorphism** rather than surface-level equivalence.


## Core Assumptions

This project adopts the following assumptions:

- Words function as labels, not as meaning itself
- Meaning arises from relational structures between concepts
- Understanding is not a matter of information volume,
  but of whether a structure can be internally reconstructed

From this perspective, operations such as:

- reducing vocabulary,
- removing content,
- extracting only “important points,”

can, in many cases, **undermine understanding rather than support it**.


## What Is an Intermediate Domain?

When people come to understand a difficult text, the following pattern often appears:

- The original text feels opaque or inaccessible
- An explanation using a different language, register, or framing suddenly makes sense
- Afterward, the original text becomes readable in structural terms

This project refers to the linguistic and conceptual space created in such moments as an
**Intermediate Domain**.

An intermediate domain is:

- not identical to the source text,
- but structurally isomorphic to it,
- and reconstructable by the learner themselves.

This repository explores methods for **intentionally generating such intermediate domains**
as a catalyst for understanding.


## What This Repository Does *Not* Aim to Do

This project does **not** aim to provide:

- automatic summaries of academic texts,
- replacement translation tools,
- “correct” simplified explanations,
- or copy-paste-ready knowledge artifacts.

The outputs generated using these prompts are **not finished products**.
They are intended as intermediate structures that support reconstruction by the learner.


## Intended Uses

The prompts and examples in this repository are intended for:

- learning and studying difficult academic or theoretical texts,
- examining whether AI-generated explanations preserve structural integrity,
- observing how register shifts trigger moments of understanding,
- thought experiments in education, humanities, and AI cognition.

As a consequence, these methods may also be applicable to:

- news articles,
- technical explanations,
- theoretical writing.

However, such applications are **secondary effects**, not the primary goal.


## Positioning of This Repository

This project is **not**:

- a completed theory,
- a software tool,
- or a method with guaranteed effectiveness.

It is an **experimental and exploratory space**
for observing and sharing the structural conditions
under which understanding may or may not emerge.

Failure, ambiguity, silence, or refusal to transform
are not errors, but meaningful observations.


## License and Use

All text and prompts in this repository may be freely used for:

- personal use,
- educational or research purposes,
- non-commercial and commercial applications.

Modification, redistribution, and derivative use are permitted.

No accuracy, effectiveness, or safety is guaranteed.
Responsibility for use lies entirely with the user.


## Final Note

This project is not about providing clarity,
answers, or shortcuts to understanding.

It is an attempt to make the **structure of understanding itself**
observable, shareable, and open to reconstruction.

If you value reconstructable intermediate structures
over polished explanations,
you are free to use, adapt, and break what is here.
